# hw-13-orm-e-commerce-back-end

Your task is to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. You’ll configure a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll also need to provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the acceptance criteria being met. You’ll need to submit a link to the video and add it to the readme of your project.

product-routes > Get FindAll, Get FindbyID, Post Create New = Working

tag-routes > Get FindAll, Get FindbyID, Post Create New = Working

Still have to do testing of product-routes Update and Delete.

Planning to base the remaining tag-routes on the product routes after they are working properly.

Then video demo of testing routes working in Insomnia or Postman.
